# Digi-Pals

## Project Overview
Digi-Pals is a prototype development project aimed at creating a small, playable Pok√©mon-inspired game using the Godot game engine. The focus is on implementing core gameplay mechanics such as character creation, exploring an environment, and engaging in turn-based battles.

## General Objective
The primary goal is to build a functional prototype that showcases the initial gameplay loop, including:
- Waking up in the player's house.
- Selecting a starter creature.
- Exploring the surrounding area and encountering wild creatures.
- Engaging in basic turn-based battles.

## Specific Objectives
1. **Gameplay Loop Implementation:**
   - Implement a simple, interactive gameplay loop with core mechanics.
2. **Character and Environment Design:**
   - Create and design characters, creatures, and the initial game map.
3. **Core Mechanics:**
   - Develop a turn-based battle system and random encounters.
4. **Database Integration:**
   - Use a database to manage creature stats, moves, and player inventory.
5. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Test the prototype for bugs and performance issues.
